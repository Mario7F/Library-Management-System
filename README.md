## Business Goal

- We have 437 books on our library shelves and need to create a database to keep track off what we have in inventory.
- Along with the solution we would like the database to be secure, reliable and if possible a cloud backup to where we can access it remotely.
- Lastly, if you could provide us a overview (csv) of what we have so we can put it into Excel this would be greatly appreciated.

## Operational Goal

- Design a database solution
- Provide the cost of the service
- Ensure all needs are met
