# Library-Management-System

## Business Goal

- We have xx amount of books on our library shelves and need to create a database to keep track off what we have in inventory.
- Along with the solution we would like the database to be secure, reliable and if possible a cloud backup to where we can access it remotely.
- Lastly, if you could provide us a overview (csv) of what we have so we can put it into Excel this would be greatly appreciated.
